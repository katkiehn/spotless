# Spotless
A website to make your cleaning process easier
https://spotless.katkiehn.de/

## overview

Spotless is a place where cleaning tasks which do not need to be done weekly are stored in a database.  According to the users' customisation, several tasks will be assigned. Tasks are assigned somewhat randomly but each task in the database has a frequency which determines how often it will appear in a certain time frame.
This allows the user to not have to think about whether it is time again to clean the fridge or dust the heaters.

- Registration and Login page with error display
- Bcrypt for password protection
- Users can customise the number of rooms and change the rooms name
- Users can decide how many cleaning tasks per week they are willing to tackle
- Cleaning progress is shown in a motivating, visually stimulating way
